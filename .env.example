# This is an example environment configuration file.

# Backend API URL
# Used by the frontend to make requests to your backend services.
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

# --- OAuth Credentials ---
# The OAuth flows in this application are backend-driven. The frontend redirects
# to backend endpoints (e.g., /api/auth/google/login) which then handle the
# communication with the OAuth providers, including the use of client secrets.
#
# Client IDs are sometimes used by the frontend to construct the initial OAuth
# redirect URL if the backend doesn't generate the full URL. In this project,
# the frontend redirects to backend URLs that manage the OAuth process, so
# these VITE_ prefixed client IDs might be used by the backend if it's configured
# to read them from environment variables passed during build time, or they serve
# as a reference for what the backend needs.

# Google OAuth Credentials
# Obtain these from the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/)
# by setting up an OAuth 2.0 client ID for your project.
# The VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID might be used by the frontend if it directly constructs
# the initial authorization URL to Google, or it's for backend reference.
# The VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET is strictly for backend use.
VITE_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE
# VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE (Handled by backend)

# GitHub OAuth Credentials
# Obtain these from your GitHub OAuth App settings (Developer settings > OAuth Apps).
# Similar to Google, VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID might be used by frontend/backend.
# The VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET is strictly for backend use.
VITE_OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID_HERE
# VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE (Handled by backend)

# Note on Client Secrets:
# Client secrets should NEVER be exposed in your frontend JavaScript bundle.
# The `VITE_` prefix makes environment variables accessible in frontend code.
# For client secrets, ensure your backend handles them securely and does not
# rely on the frontend to pass them. The placeholders above for secrets are
# for documentation and awareness of the complete OAuth setup.
# The backend endpoints (/api/auth/google/callback, etc.) will use the actual
# client secrets configured on the server-side.
